      <h1>Responsive Layouts don't have to be a struggle</h1>
      <p>If we work <em>with</em> the browser instead of fighting against it, it can go from a frustrating experience to smooth sailing. It takes a bit of a mindset shift to start working with the browser, as well as time and practice to learn how to implement things correctly, but always remember, if something isn't responsive, it's probably a line of CSS that <em>you</em> wrote that's causing the issue!</p>
      <p>Also, it can be hard to see what's going on, so adding background colors to things to help visualize everything is very useful!</p>

        <h2>Work with the browser</h2>
        <p>Websites without any CSS are responsive! At least for the most part, images and a few other things do need a little help.</p>

        <h2>Layouts vs Content</h2>
        <p>You should try to separate these concerns as much as possible, creating layouts, and then placing content in those layouts.</p>

        <h2>We have two layout tools for a reason</h2>
        <p>It can be tempting to want to learn either flexbox or grid, but we have both tools for a reason. Learn what each one is good at, and lean into those strengths!</p>
